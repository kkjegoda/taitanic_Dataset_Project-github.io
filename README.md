# taitanic_Dataset_Project-github.io

📘 Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset used to teach data science and machine learning. 
The goal is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
Using Python and its data analysis libraries, this notebook walks through the process of data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation. 
The insights gathered here can serve as a foundation for building predictive models.


🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📊 EDA Objectives

Inspect the structure of the dataset
Identify and handle missing data
Explore feature distributions
Analyze correlations and survival impact
Visualize relationships between variables
Derive key insights and storytelling from data

🔍 Key Findings

Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
Class: Passengers from higher classes (especially 1st class) were more likely to survive.
Age: Children (especially under 10) had better survival odds.
Fare & Embarkation: Higher fares and boarding from Cherbourg (C) were associated with better survival chances.

📈 Sample Visualizations

Survival distribution by sex and class (stacked bar charts)
Age distribution across survivors and non-survivors (histograms)
Heatmaps to show correlations among numeric features
Box plots to show fare variation by class and survival status

📌 Conclusion

The Titanic dataset provides a great starting point to practice data analysis, cleaning, and visualization. Through EDA, we uncover hidden patterns and relationships that are crucial for building machine learning models or for data storytelling.
